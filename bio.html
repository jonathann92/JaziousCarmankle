  camps&quot;) give students a place to focus on completing their
  writing projects, with help of all kinds available to get them
  over obstacles. My coaching practice involves working with students
  individually in person, by phone, or over e-mail to help them
  for advisors and proposal workshops for students and their advisors
  to facilitate the thesis and dissertation process.</FONT><P>

  is the effort to disrupt the ideology of domination that pervades
  Western culture and the effort to transform it into a culture
  and relationships characterized by mutuality, respect, self-determination,
  it occurs, whether of women, people of color, old people, gays
  and lesbians, friends, or family.</FONT><P>
